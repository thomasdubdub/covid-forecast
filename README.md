# COVID-19 forecast in French departments

Visualize a forecast (linear growth by department) of the evolution of the COVID-19 hospitalizations in French departments

COVID-19 and geographical data come from the [French open data portal](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/)

Data are stored as [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) / [GeoPandas](http://geopandas.org/) dataframes

Forecast of time series (number of hospitalizations per department) is realized with [Facebook Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/)

Graphical visualization is realized with [contextily](https://github.com/darribas/contextily), PIL and matplotlib




Example: forecast of the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations in French departments in the next week (historical data to 25/03/20)
